<h2>Position:</h2>
I am a researcher (chargé de recherche, CNRS) in Center of Mathematics Laurent Schwartz, École Polytechnique. 
From September 2019 to October 2021, I was as a postdoctoral researcher in Université Grenoble Alpes, France, working under the direction of
<a href="https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~demailly/">Jean-Pierre Demailly</a>.
Prior to that I was a graduate student in Université Paris Diderot, France, working under the direction of <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~xiaonan.ma/">Xiaonan Ma</a>.

<h2>Research interests:</h2>

I am mainly interested in global analysis on manifolds, complex geometry, Atiyah-Singer theorem, local index theory and probability theory.
<p>
Recently I also became concerned about applications of global analysis techniques to the study of some critical phenomenons in statistical mechanics.
<p>
In my thesis I have studied the properties of holomorphic analytic torsion on complex manifolds. More precisely, I've worked on the zeta-regularized determinanants on the non-compact surfaces, admitting hyperbolic cusps.
