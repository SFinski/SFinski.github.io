<h2>Position:</h2>
I recently defended my PhD in Université Paris Diderot under the direction of <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~xiaonan.ma/">Xiaonan Ma</a>.
Now I am a post-doc under the direction of
<a href="https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~demailly/">Jean-Pierre Demailly</a> in Université Grenoble Alpes, France.

<h2>Research interests:</h2>

I am mainly interested in global analysis on manifolds, Atiyah-Singer theorem, local index theory, Riemann surfaces, flat surfaces, moduli spaces, dynamics and L<sup>2</sup> invariants.
<p>
Recently I also became interested in the spectral behavior of metrized simplicial approximations of a Riemannian manifold when the mesh of the approximation goes to zero.
<p>
In my thesis I have studied the properties of holomorphic analytic torsion on complex manifolds. More precisely, I've worked on the analytic torsion on the non-compact surfaces, admitting hyperbolic cusps.
