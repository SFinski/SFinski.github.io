<h2>Position:</h2>
I am a researcher (chargé de recherche, CNRS) in Center of Mathematics Laurent Schwartz, École Polytechnique. 

<h2>Research interests:</h2>

I am mainly interested in global analysis on manifolds and complex geometry. Based on the methods from those areas, my work relates to Atiyah-Singer theorem, local index theory, semi-classical analysis and probability theory.
