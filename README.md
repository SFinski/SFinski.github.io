I am a mathematician working in geometry.

<h2>Research interests:</h2>

I'm interested in global analysis on manifolds and complex geometry. Based on the methods from these areas, my work relates to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, local index theory, semi-classical analysis and probability theory.

<h2>Current position:</h2>
Researcher (chargé de recherche, CNRS) in Center of Mathematics Laurent Schwartz, École Polytechnique.
