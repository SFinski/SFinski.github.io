<h2>Position:</h2>
I am a researcher (chargé de recherche, CNRS) in Center of Mathematics Laurent Schwartz, École Polytechnique. 
From September 2019 to October 2021, I was as a postdoctoral researcher in Université Grenoble Alpes, France, working under the direction of
<a href="https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~demailly/">Jean-Pierre Demailly</a>.
Prior to that, I was a graduate student at Université Paris Diderot, France, working under the direction of <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~xiaonan.ma/">Xiaonan Ma</a>.

<h2>Research interests:</h2>

I am mainly interested in global analysis on manifolds and complex geometry. Based on the methods from those areas, my work relates to Atiyah-Singer theorem, local index theory, semi-classical analysis and probability theory.
