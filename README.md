<h2>Position:</h2>
I am third year PhD student in Universit√© Paris Diderot under the direction of Xiaonan Ma.

<h2>Research interests:</h2>

I am mainly intereseted in global analysis on manifolds, local Atiyah-Singer theory, flat surfaces, dynamics and L<sup>2</sup> invariants.
<br/>
In my thesis I study the properties of holomorphic analytic torsion on complex manifolds. More precisely, we study there the analytic torsion on the non-compact surfaces, admitting hyperbolic cusps.
