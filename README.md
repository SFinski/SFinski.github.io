<h2>Position:</h2>
I am a third year PhD student in pure mathematics in Universit√© Paris Diderot under the direction of <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~xiaonan.ma/">Xiaonan Ma</a>.

<h2>Research interests:</h2>

I am mainly interested in global analysis on manifolds, local Atiyah-Singer theory, Riemann surfaces, flat surfaces, moduli spaces, dynamics and L<sup>2</sup> invariants.
<p>
Recently I also became interested in the spectral behavior of metrized simplicial approximations of a Riemannian manifold when the mesh of the approximation goes to zero.
<p>
In my thesis I have studied the properties of holomorphic analytic torsion on complex manifolds. More precisely, I've worked on the analytic torsion on the non-compact surfaces, admitting hyperbolic cusps.
